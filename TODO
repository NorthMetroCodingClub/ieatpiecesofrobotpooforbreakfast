Fix issue with dumb robots repeatedly trying to move into same cell and dead-locking.

Is it just me or do you instantly die if you are on a spawn tile during spawning, 
even if there isn't a robot gettign spawned at that specific tile?  
If so, quit playing around those tiles, buttmunch.

In genera: go through code with relatively fine-toothed comb and verify that it is actually doing what I think it is.  
No semantic errors or whatever...
