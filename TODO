Figure out when to attack a tile before an enemy moves into it.  And do that attack while retreating balogna.

What about targeting adjacent locations for enemies, to avoid falling into traps?

Go through code with relatively fine-toothed comb and verify that it is actually doing what I think it is.  
No semantic errors or whatever...
